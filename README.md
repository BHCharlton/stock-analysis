# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
Our client, Steve, wanted to continue using the workbook we had made for him, but needed to expand his research to the entire stock market as a way to determine what stocks were worth investing in.  Thus, it was important to ensure that the VBA code would still be able to run quickly and efficiently when processing much larger sets of data.  The purpose of this challenge was to "refactor" the code that had already been written throughout the Module to process stock information for an entire year that would provide the total daily volume for the selected year as well as the overall return of each stock for that year.

## Process
Market information for twelve different stocks during the years 2017 and 2018 is used in this challenge to test the efficacy of the refactored VBA code.  The data provides a ticker for each stock along with the date it was issued, an opening and closing price for that stock, the all-time high and low price, as well as the adjusted closing price and total volume.  I began by downloading the provided "starter code," then made the appropriate additions to the code, as outlined in the challenge, to refactor the script to run more efficiently.  I then used the provided market information as a means for testing the efficacy of my additions.

## Results
The following images show the results of running the refactored VBA code for the years 2017 and 2018.  These images are also available in the repository:
